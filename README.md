# pRISM
*Procedural Intelligence & RAG-based Semantic Multi-Model*

pRISM combines RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with multi-model consensus to create more reliable AI outputs, specifically designed for legal document processing. By integrating multiple language models and incorporating human expert feedback, we aim to make AI-generated legal content more transparent and trustworthy.

> **Note**: This is a research project - please don't use it for actual legal work without expert review!

## What Makes pRISM Different?

- **Multi-Model Consensus**: Instead of relying on a single LLM, we aggregate outputs from multiple models using techniques like weighted majority voting. In our testing, this has significantly reduced hallucination rates (full benchmarks coming soon).

- **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning**: We use LoRA to adapt models for legal tasks without breaking the bank on compute costs. Our initial tests show promising improvements in legal terminology accuracy.

- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Legal experts review outputs and provide feedback, which gets incorporated back into the system to improve future results.

## Quick Start

1. Clone and install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pRISM.git
cd pRISM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Core Components

### RAG Pipeline (`rag_pipeline.py`)
The heart of pRISM. Handles document retrieval and generation using FAISS for vector search and LangChain for orchestration. Check out `examples/rag_demo.py` for a simple use case.

### Real-Time API (`real_time_inference_api.py`)
FastAPI service for running inferences. Currently supports:
- Basic document queries
- Multi-model consensus outputs
- Confidence scoring
- Explanation generation

### Evaluation Tools
- `performance_benchmarking.py`: Measures latency and accuracy
- `evaluation_report_generator.py`: Generates detailed PDF reports
- `automated_feedback_loops.py`: Incorporates user feedback for continuous improvement

## Roadmap (2025)
- [ ] Add support for more recent model versions
- [ ] Improve consensus algorithms based on early testing
- [ ] Release benchmark results comparing single vs multi-model accuracy
- [ ] Add more detailed legal domain examples
